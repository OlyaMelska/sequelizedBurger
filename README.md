# burger

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page - waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

TOOLS: • MySQL • Sequelize • Node.js • Express.js • JavaScript • Handlebars • HTML • CSS • jQuery • Bootstrap

Enter a name of the burger in the "Enter a burger and click a submit button field".
Press submit. It handles a POST request to the API and writes a burder name to the mySQL database.
When added, you can click devour button and it will make a GET request, compare the value (unique id) and change the position of html element into another <div>
